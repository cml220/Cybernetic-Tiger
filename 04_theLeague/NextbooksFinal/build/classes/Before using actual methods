In order for the prototype PDFReader to be functional a MySQL database named "cmpt370" must be hosted locally,
or the static variable dbname must be changed to the name of one that is hosted locally. The code accesses a table called "pdf"
with 3 columns: "pdf_id", "title" and "url". The table contains 3 example rows to provide a rudimentary example of how the reader works.

The table and rows can be created by running the following query in your localhost database:
CREATE  TABLE `cmpt370`.`pdf` (
  `pdf_id` INT NOT NULL ,
  `title` VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL ,
  `url` VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL ,
  PRIMARY KEY (`pdf_id`) ,
  UNIQUE INDEX `pdf_id_UNIQUE` (`pdf_id` ASC) ,
  UNIQUE INDEX `title_UNIQUE` (`title` ASC) ,
  UNIQUE INDEX `url_UNIQUE` (`url` ASC) );
INSERT INTO cmpt370.pdf VALUES ('1','Patterns','http://www.cs.usask.ca/faculty/gutwin/281/lectures/02-patterns.pdf');
INSERT INTO cmpt370.pdf VALUES ('2','Visual Appearance','http://www.cs.usask.ca/faculty/gutwin/281/lectures/04-visual-appearance.pdf');
INSERT INTO cmpt370.pdf VALUES ('3','Introduction','http://www.cs.usask.ca/faculty/gutwin/281/lectures/00-course-intro.pdf');lty/gutwin/281/lectures/00-course-intro.pdf');

If this is done completely and correctly the commented out lines within main can be uncommented 
and the FAKE ones should be commented out instead.
